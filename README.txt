#Quickbar

QuickBar adds an Evo-style Quick Edit bar to the front end of your site. For logged in users only of course.

You'll see a thin green strip at the top. Hovering over it will slide down a bar with Edit Resource, Dashboard and Create Here buttons.

Supports Articles, meaning if you are viewing an Article Container, clicking Create Here, will take you to a page to create a new Article within that container. If you are viewing an Article, you'll be taken to a page to create a new Article in the same Article Container.

This is the initial commit so leaving the 'pieces' of the addon as Chunks and Snippets viewable in the admin. Overtime, may move them to be more behind the scenes.
